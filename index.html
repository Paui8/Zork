<p>Years ago,  Mike and his crew were in a museum to steal the Great Emerald. While they were stealing the emerald, a demon appeared. The demon threatened  Mike  to kill all his crew unless he join the demon. So Mike made a deal with one of the most powerful demon of the Hell to save his friends. His name was Samael and he was looking for a strong soul in the Earth. Samael wanted the chosen to become his servant when he dies. He wanted to use the soul of the chosen to convert it into a demon and kill Azazel, who was reigning in the Hell. Since that day Mike started to train his soul and his mind to become a powerful demon when he dies.</p>
