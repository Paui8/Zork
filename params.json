While they were stealing the emerald, a demon appeared. The demon threatened  Mike  to kill all his crew unless he join the demon. So Mike made a deal with one of the most powerful demon of the Hell to save his friends. His name was Samael and he was looking for a strong soul in the Earth. Samael wanted the chosen to become his servant when he dies. He wanted to use the soul of the chosen to convert it into a demon and kill Azazel, who was reigning in the Hell. Since that day Mike started to train his soul and his mind to become a powerful demon when he dies.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know more about the History of the game enter to the wiki page.\r\n[Zork: Path to Hell](https://github.com/Paui8/Zork/wiki)\r\n\r\nHere's a link to the original game Zork: [Original Zork](http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/5zyoqrsugeopel3ffhz_vq/zork)\r\n\r\nAnd a little map to help you to find the path to the Hell.\r\n\r\n![MAP](https://i.gyazo.com/cbefbb5817d598f714059460672d9396.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for watching,\r\nPau Bordes.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
